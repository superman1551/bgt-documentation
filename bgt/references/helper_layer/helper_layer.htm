<b>Helper Layer</b><br>
<br>
The helper layer consists of functions and objects that are included as part of the BGT distribution, but that are stored as separate scripts that should be included in a main script. These are high level commonly used game tasks based around the foundation layer and their use is entirely optional. As their name suggests, they are there to help the task of coding your game become less painful and taxing.<br>
<br>
Examples of helper objects include dynamic_menu, for creating a game menu, and number_speaker, a class that will concatenate number files in whatever way necessary in order to speak numbers as smoothly and naturally as possible. Helper functions include functions to simplify the positioning of sound sources in an environment, etc.<br>
