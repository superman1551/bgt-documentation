<b>number_speaker object</b><br>
<br>
This method will speak a number from -999999999 to 999999999.<br>
<br>
int speak(double the_number)<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
the_number<br>
The number to speak.<br>
<br>
Return value:<br>
0 on success, -1 on failure.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
The speak method will look for sounds in accordance with the values stored in the prepend and append properties, and ascertain the best sound files to load by performing a number of searches based on the number at hand.<br>
<br>
This function will return immediately when called, allowing the script to do other things while the number is being spoken. It is therefore necessary to call the speak_next method continuously to ensure that the numbers are spoken as smoothly and fluently as possible.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<pre>
// Speak a number using speak and speak_next.

#include "number_speaker.bgt"

void main()
{
number_speaker test;
test.prepend="numbers/";
test.speak(1056);
while(test.speak_next()==1)
{
wait(5);
}
}
</pre>
