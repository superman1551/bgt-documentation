<b>tts_voice object</b><br>
<br>
int volume<br>
This determines how loudly the voice will speak. 0 is the original volume, and -100 is completely silent. This is set to -1 on error. Please note that volume is not automatically set to 0 when it loads, but will instead reflect the volume that is set in the control panel.<br>
<br>
int rate<br>
This is the speed at which the voice will speak. Values range from -10 (slowest) to 10 (fastest), where 0 is normal. This is set to -1 on error. Please note that rate is not automatically set to 0 when it loads, but will instead reflect the speed that is set in the control panel.<br>
<br>
int pitch<br>
This is the pitch at which the voice will speak. Values range from -10 (lowest) to 10 (highest, where 0 is normal. This is set to -1 on error. The pitch is always 0 initially. Please note that some text-to-speech engines do not support pitch, in which case this property has no effect.<br>
<br>
bool active<br>
This is set to true if Sapi was initialised successfully, and to false otherwise. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
bool speaking<br>
This is set to true when Sapi is speaking, and to false when it is not, or if an error has occurred. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
