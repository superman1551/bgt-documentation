<b>tts_voice object</b><br>
<br>
This method will speak a given string, interrupting all other queued strings, and will pause execution until the string is spoken.<br>
<br>
bool speak_interrupt_wait(string text)<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
text<br>
The text to speak.<br>
<br>
Return value:<br>
true on success, false on failure.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
All previous text queued by the speak or speak_interrupt method will be cleared, and the new text spoken straight away.<br>
<br>
Because script execution is paused while the text inside the speak_interrupt_wait method is being spoken, it cannot be stopped or interrupted.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<pre>
// Add various text to a buffer and interrupt it.

tts_voice speech;

void main()
{
speech.speak("This is text1.");
speech.speak("This is text2.");
speech.speak("This is text3.");
wait(300);
speech.speak_interrupt_wait("This is text4 interrupting all previous announcements.");
}
</pre>
