<b>http object</b><br>
<br>
This method retrieves any new data from a currently active download using either the get or post methods.<br>
<br>
string request()<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
None.<br>
<br>
Return value:<br>
The data from the server on success, or a blank string on failure.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
This method checks if any new data has been returned by the server since the last call, and returns it as a string. It must be called continuously, without any long pauses, if the retrieval is to succeed. You must keep calling this function until the progress boolean property reports false.<br>
<br>
Please note that it is perfectly normal for this method to return a blank string without any error having occured. This simply means that no new data was provided by the server since the last call. Always call get_last_error to detect if an actual error has occured.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<pre>
// Retrieve the contents of the index page at blastbay.com.

void main()
{
http download;
string body=download.get("http://www.blastbay.com/");
if(get_last_error()!=0)
{
alert("Error", "An error occured.\r\nDescription: " + body + "");
}
else
{
while(download.progress)
{
body+=download.request();
wait(5);
}
clipboard_copy_text(body);
alert("Success", "The data was retrieved and has been copied to your clipboard.");
}
}
</pre>
