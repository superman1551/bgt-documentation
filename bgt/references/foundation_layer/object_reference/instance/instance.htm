<b>instance object</b><br>
<br>
The instance object is used to check whether a given game is already running.<br>
<br>
instance(string application_name)<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
application_name<br>
An optional unique name that is used internally for the game.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
This object is useful if you wish to prevent multiple instances of the same game from being opened at the same time.<br>
<br>
If the application_name argument is specified, it must be no more than 100 characters in length. If it is not specified, it will default to a hash of the game executable and hence will not work if trying to prevent an older version of a game from running alongside an updated copy.<br>
<br>
Note: This class will only work if the game is compiled.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<pre>
/*
Write a script that checks for another instance of itself. To make this script work effectively you must run it at least twice within ten seconds of the first instance being started.
*/

void main()
{
instance the_game("instance_checker");
if(the_game.is_already_running)
{
alert("Error", "This script is already running.");
exit();
}
wait(10000);
}
</pre>
