<b>pack_file object</b><br>
<br>
This method will open an existing pack file for reading.<br>
<br>
bool open(string filename)<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
filename<br>
The pack file on disk to open.<br>
<br>
Return value:<br>
true on success, false on failure.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
When you call this method, the pack file will be opened in read mode. Please note that a pack file cannot be added to once closed unless it is recreated from scratch.<br>
<br>
Note that both \ and / can be used to specify paths.<br>
<br>
If you pass * to this function, the engine will attempt to open a pack file that has been included into the program itself. For more information on how this is done, see the tutorial on packaging files with your executable.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<pre>
// Open a pack file and extract some data.

void main()
{
pack_file test;
test.open("pack.dat");
test.extract_file("t1","test1.txt");
test.extract_file("t2","test2.txt");
test.extract_file("t3","test3.txt");
test.close();
}
</pre>
