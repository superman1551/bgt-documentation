<b>pack_file object</b><br>
<br>
This method will close any pack file associated with the object.<br>
<br>
bool close()<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
None.<br>
<br>
Return value:<br>
true on success, false on failure.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
This method is executed automatically when the object is destroyed, so you need not worry about calling it to clean up after yourself at the end of your script for example. This method is also executed if you call either the create or open method on a pack_file object that already has a pack associated with it.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<pre>
// Create a pack file and add some test files.

void main()
{
pack_file test;
test.create("pack.dat");
test.add_file("test1.txt","t1");
test.add_file("test2.txt","t2");
test.add_file("test3.txt","t3");
test.close();
}
</pre>
