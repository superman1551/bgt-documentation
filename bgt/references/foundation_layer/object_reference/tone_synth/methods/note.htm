<b>tone_synth object</b><br>
<br>
This method generates a given note or list of notes that will last for a specified number of beats.<br>
<br>
bool note(string notes, double length)<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
notes<br>
A string specifying a note or list of notes to generate.<br>
length<br>
The length of the notes, in beats.<br>
<br>
Return value:<br>
true on success, false on failure.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
Notes are written inside a string and are separated by a comma and space. Values inside notes are case sensitive.<br>
<br>
Notes are written as the note letter from A to G (notice that they are upper case), followed by the octave number. To sharpen a note add a # after the note and before the number, and to flatten it use a b (lower case). Middle C is C4. Valid notes are from C0 to D#8/Eb8.<br>
<br>
The notes provided in the list will be generated together (as opposed to separately, one after the other), allowing for easier and quicker creation of chords.<br>
<br>
The length is specified in number of beats based on the beats per minute specified in the tempo property.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<pre>
// Write a B major chord.

tone_synth synth;

void main()
{
synth.note("B3, D#4, Gb4", 4);
synth.write_wave_file("wave.wav");
}
</pre>
