<b>joystick object</b><br>
<br>
This function checks if a particular button on the joystick has been pressed.<br>
<br>
bool button_pressed(int button)<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
button<br>
The ID of a joystick button to check (see remarks).<br>
<br>
Return value:<br>
true if the button has been pressed, false if it has not or if an error occurs.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
The difference between button_down and button_pressed is that button_pressed will only return true when the user first pushes down the button, while button_down will continue returning true until the button is released again.<br>
<br>
The joystick object supports up to 128 buttons, ranging from 0 to 127. However the actual maximum button is determined by the buttons property for the given device, ranging from 0 to buttons minus 1.<br>
<br>
It is important to remember when mapping functions to joystick buttons that devices can vary greatly between models, supporting anything between 3 and 15 buttons, and therefore it is always a good idea to map the most common activities to buttons with lower numbers.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<pre>
// Play a looping sound whenever a button is pressed.

void main()
{
sound loop;
joystick stick;
int current_loop=-1;
show_game_window("Joystick Test");
if(stick.joysticks==0)
{
alert("Error", "No joysticks seem to be attached.");
exit();
}
while(!key_pressed(KEY_ESCAPE))
{
for(int counter=0; counter&lt;stick.buttons; counter++)
{
if(stick.button_pressed(counter))
{
if(current_loop!=counter)
{
loop.load("loop"+counter+".wav");
current_loop=counter;
}
loop.play_looped();
}
if(stick.button_released(counter))
{
loop.stop();
}
}
}
}
