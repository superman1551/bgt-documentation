<br>
<b>joystick object</b><br>
<br>
This function returns a list of all the buttons on the joystick that are currently up.<br>
<br>
int[] buttons_up()<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
None.<br>
<br>
Return value:<br>
An array with the buttons that are up, or an empty array if no buttons are up or if an error occurs.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
The difference between buttons_up and buttons_released is that buttons_released will only return a list of the buttons that the user has just released, while buttons_up will return a list of the buttons that are currently up regardless of whether the same buttons have been reported as being up in a previous call.<br>
<br>
The joystick object supports up to 128 buttons, ranging from 0 to 127. However the actual maximum button is determined by the buttons property for the given device, ranging from 0 to buttons minus 1.<br>
<br>
It is important to remember when mapping functions to joystick buttons that devices can vary greatly between models, supporting anything between 3 and 15 buttons, and therefore it is always a good idea to map the most common activities to buttons with lower numbers.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<pre>
// The example will constantly monitor buttons that are up. If it registers three or more buttons that are not up, it will exit.

void main()
{
show_game_window("buttons up Test");
int[] button_list;
joystick stick;
if(stick.joysticks==0)
{
alert("Error", "No joysticks seem to be attached.");
exit();
}
button_list=stick.buttons_up();
while(button_list.length()>125)
{
button_list=stick.buttons_up();
wait(5);
}
}
</pre>
