<b>joystick object</b><br>
<br>
uint joysticks<br>
The number of joysticks that are currently attached. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
bool has_x<br>
Checks to see if the joystick has an x axis. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
bool has_y<br>
Checks to see if the joystick has a y axis. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
bool has_z<br>
Checks to see if the joystick has a z axis. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
bool has_r_x<br>
Checks to see if the joystick has a rotational x axis. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
bool has_r_y<br>
Checks to see if the joystick has a rotational y axis. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
bool has_r_z<br>
Checks to see if the joystick has a rotational z axis. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
uint buttons<br>
The number of buttons on the device. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
uint sliders<br>
The number of sliders on the device. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
uint povs<br>
The number of povs (point of view controls) on the device. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
string name<br>
The name of the device that is currently being used. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
bool active<br>
This is true if a joystick device is opened, false if not. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
int preferred_joystick<br>
Returns the index of the joystick that the user has set as their preferred device in the control panel. This corresponds to the list returned by list_joysticks, and is never greater than the joysticks property -1. On error or if there is no default, -1 is returned. This property cannot be modified in the script.<br>
<br>
long x<br>
X-axis, usually the left-right movement of a stick. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
long y<br>
Y-axis, usually the forward-backward movement of a stick. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
long z<br>
Z-axis, often the throttle control. If the joystick does not have this axis, the value is 0. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
long r_x<br>
X-axis rotation. If the joystick does not have this axis, the value is 0. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
long r_y<br>
Y-axis rotation. If the joystick does not have this axis, the value is 0. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
long r_z<br>
Z-axis rotation (often called the rudder). If the joystick does not have this axis, the value is 0. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
long slider_1<br>
An additional axis value (formerly called the u-axis) whose semantics depend on the joystick. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
long slider_2<br>
An additional axis value (formerly called the v-axis) whose semantics depend on the joystick. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
uint pov_1<br>
Direction controller, such as point-of-view hat. The position is indicated in hundredths of a degree clockwise from north (away from the user). The center position is normally reported as - 1, but not all devices follow this rule. To check if a POV is centered, use the pov_centered method. For indicators that have only five positions, the value for a controller is - 1, 0, 9,000, 18,000, or 27,000. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
uint pov_2<br>
Direction controller, such as point-of-view hat. The position is indicated in hundredths of a degree clockwise from north (away from the user). The center position is normally reported as - 1, but not all devices follow this rule. To check if a POV is centered, use the pov_centered method. For indicators that have only five positions, the value for a controller is - 1, 0, 9,000, 18,000, or 27,000. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
uint pov_3<br>
Direction controller, such as point-of-view hat. The position is indicated in hundredths of a degree clockwise from north (away from the user). The center position is normally reported as - 1, but not all devices follow this rule. To check if a POV is centered, use the pov_centered method. For indicators that have only five positions, the value for a controller is - 1, 0, 9,000, 18,000, or 27,000. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
<br>
uint pov_4<br>
Direction controller, such as point-of-view hat. The position is indicated in hundredths of a degree clockwise from north (away from the user). The center position is normally reported as - 1, but not all devices follow this rule. To check if a POV is centered, use the pov_centered method. For indicators that have only five positions, the value for a controller is - 1, 0, 9,000, 18,000, or 27,000. This property cannot be modified from the script.<br>
