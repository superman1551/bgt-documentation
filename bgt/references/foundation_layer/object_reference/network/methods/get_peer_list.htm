<b>network object</b><br>
<br>
This method will return an array containing the unique ID's of all connected peers.<br>
<br>
uint[] get_peer_list()<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
None.<br>
<br>
Return value:<br>
An array containing the unique ID's of all connected peers on success, or an array with 0 elements on error.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
This method is useful for sending messages to all connected peers, as the returned array can easily be used in a loop to send the same message to everyone. Please note that the same functionality can be achieved by passing 0 as the peer ID to either the send_unreliable or send_reliable methods.<br>
<br>
This function is also useful when you wish to disconnect all peers gracefully before destroying the host.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
See the main network chapter.<br>
