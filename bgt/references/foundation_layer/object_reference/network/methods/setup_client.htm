<b>network object</b><br>
<br>
This method will initialise and set up the network object in client mode.<br>
<br>
bool setup_client(int channels, int max_peers)<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
channels<br>
The number of channels that are used by the client. The maximum is 100.<br>
max_peers<br>
The maximum number of peers that the client can be connected with simultaneously. The maximum is 4000.<br>
<br>
Return value:<br>
true if the client was set up successfully, false otherwise.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
This method is used to set up the network object in client mode. This means that it will not listen for any incoming connections.<br>
<br>
Please note that it is perfectly legal for a client to make more than one outgoing connection at once, hence the max_peers parameter.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
See the main network chapter.<br>
