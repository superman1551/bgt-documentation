<b>Foundation Layer</b><br>
<br>
The foundation layer consists of functions and objects that are available in the engine itself. These are the bare basics, and are what all scripts will use.<br>
<br>
Examples of foundation objects include timers, used for measuring time accurately, sounds, used for playing and manipulating audio, and dictionaries, used for storing and retrieving large numbers of variables.<br>
<br>
Foundation functions include error handling, variable conversions, keyboard management and simple user interface functions.<br>
