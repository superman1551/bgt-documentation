<br>
<b>keys_pressed</b><br>
<br>
This function returns a list of all the keys on the keyboard that have just been pressed.<br>
<br>
int[] keys_pressed()<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
None.<br>
<br>
Return value:<br>
An array with the keys that have just been pressed, or an empty array if no keys have been pressed since the last call or if an error occurs.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
The difference between keys_down and keys_pressed is that keys_pressed will only return a list of the keys that the user has just pushed down, while keys_down will return a list of the keys that are currently being held down regardless of whether the same keys have been reported as being down in a previous call.<br>
<br>
Please note that keys_pressed and key_pressed use the same keyboard state, so if a call to keys_pressed is made right before a call to key_pressed, none of the keys returned by keys_pressed will be reported as just having been pushed down by key_pressed. The same holds true for the reverse scenario.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<pre>
// Speak the key codes of any keys that are pressed, and exit if the user presses escape.

void main()
{
show_game_window("Keys Pressed Test");
tts_voice speech;
int[] list;
while(key_pressed(KEY_ESCAPE)==false)
{
list=keys_pressed();
for(uint i=0;i&lt;list.length();i++)
{
if(i==0)
{
speech.speak_interrupt(list[i]);
}
else
{
speech.speak(list[i]);
}
}
wait(5);
}
}
</pre>
