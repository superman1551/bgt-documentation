<br>
<b>force_key_down</b><br>
<br>
This function causes a given key to assume the state of being held down.<br>
<br>
bool force_key_down(int key)<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
key<br>
One of the BGT key name constants, see appendix A for a full list.<br>
<br>
Return value:<br>
true on success, false on failure.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
Forcing keys is useful for controlling certain aspects of games. For example, if you wanted a game to completely replay itself in the player's style, you might record the code and length of each key pressed in a previous game, and code the replay so that all the keys are forced up or down at the right moments, thereby completely simulating the player's actions.<br>
<br>
The state of the key being forced is only recognised by the script calling the function - the key itself is not physically pressed down on the keyboard, nor is the key held down or indeed controlled in any way according to any other application.<br>
<br>
To reset the state of the key so that it can again be controlled by the user, use either the reset_forced_key or reset_all_forced_keys function.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<pre>
/*
This is a small example that plays the Windows ding every second while the space bar is pressed. If the f key is pressed, the script will force the space key down, thereby triggering the ding to play whether the space bar is physically pressed or not.
*/

void main()
{
sound ding;
timer time;
ding.load("c:/windows/media/ding.wav");
show_game_window("Ding Test");
while(true)
{
if((time.elapsed&lt;1000)||(!key_down(KEY_SPACE)))
{
if((key_pressed(KEY_ESCAPE))||((key_down(KEY_LMENU))&&(key_pressed(KEY_F4))))
{
exit();
}
if(key_pressed(KEY_F))
{
force_key_down(KEY_SPACE);
}
wait(5);
continue;
}
time.restart();
ding.play();
}
}
