<br>
<b>get_sound_storage</b><br>
<br>
This function gets the location of the pack file in which the engine will look for sound files loaded through the sound object.<br>
<br>
string get_sound_storage()<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
None.<br>
<br>
Return value:<br>
The name on success, or an empty string on failure.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
Note that both \ and / can be used to specify paths.<br>
<br>
If an empty string is returned by this function, it means that the engine will not look for sounds in a pack file but will attempt to locate requested files on disk instead. This is the default behavior.<br>
<br>
If the function returns *, it means that the engine will attempt to look for sounds in a pack file that has been included into the program itself. For more information on how this is done, see the tutorial on packaging files with your executable.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<pre>
// Tell the engine to look for sound files in a file called sounds.dat, and then print this.

void main()
{
set_sound_storage("sounds.dat");
alert("Sound storage", "The sound storage is " + get_sound_storage() + ".");
}
</pre>
