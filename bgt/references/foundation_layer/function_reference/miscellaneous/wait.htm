<br>
<b>wait</b><br>
<br>
This function pauses the entire script for a certain number of millisecunds.<br>
<br>
bool wait(int milliseconds)<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
milliseconds<br>
The number of milliseconds to wait. This must not be less than 0.<br>
<br>
Return value:<br>
true on success, false on failure.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
This function completely interrupts the script for the specified amount of time. This includes all real-time activities such as checking timers, keyboard input etc. It is thus not advisable to wait for a long time in situations where the program needs to be responsive. However, waiting for about 5 milliseconds in your main game loop as well as other loops that run for a long time is highly recommended, as it reduces the CPU usage of your program enormously without affecting its speed. If you fail to do this, your game will consume 100 % of the CPU at all times.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<pre>
// Display a message, wait for three seconds, and then display another one.

void main()
{
alert("Waiting","About to wait for three seconds.");
wait(3000);
alert("Thanks","Thanks for waiting for me. Goodbye.");
}
</pre>
