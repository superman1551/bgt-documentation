<b>Script Properties</b><br>
<br>
These are properties used to determine the current script information.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>SCRIPT_COMPILED - Boolean (true if the script is a compiled executable, false otherwise).</li>
<li>SCRIPT_CURRENT_LINE - Integer (the line that is currently being executed, relative to the current script file).</li>
<li>script_current_file - String (the full path and filename of the script that is currently being executed). If the property is retrieved from within a compiled game, the path is that of the source file on the original development machine.</li>
<li>SCRIPT_CURRENT_FUNCTION - String (the full declaration of the function that is currently being executed).</li>
<li>SCRIPT_EXECUTABLE - String (the full path of the script executable file. If the script is not compiled, this is the location of bgt.exe).</li>
<li>COMMAND_LINE - String (the command line parameters given to a compiled BGT game executable. This is always empty for non-compiled scripts).</li>
<li>BGT_VERSION - Double (the version of BGT that is being used to run the script.</li>
<li>BGT_REVISION - Integer (the revision relative to the current version of BGT that is being used to run the script.</li>
</ul>
