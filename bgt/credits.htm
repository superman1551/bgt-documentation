<br>
We wish to thank the following people for their respective contributions:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/">The Angel Script Project</a><br>
AngelScript is the scripting interpreter used in BGT, and is what gives the engine its infinite flexibility and power while still maintaining language simplicity.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://enet.bespin.org/">The ENet Project</a><br>
ENet is a rock solid layer on top of the UDP protocol, optimized especially for high-speed games. This is what BGT uses to provide its networking capabilities.<br>
Note: For licensing information related to the ENet library, please see the website linked to above.<br>
<br>
Damien C. Pendleton<br>
A huge thanks goes to Damien Pendleton for co-writing as well as maintaining the ever expanding BGT documentation, as well as writing some include scripts and a great number of the string related functions found in the engine.<br>
<br>
Felix Grützmacher<br>
We also wish to express a big thanks to Felix Grützmacher for his fantastic series of tutorials on how to create games from the ground up, his pathfinding tutorial, as well as for his creative ideas and suggestions during the long months of development.<br>
<br>
We would also like to extend our thanks to our infinitely patient and skilful beta team members (Damien Pendleton, Lukás Hosnedl, Oriol Gómez and Joshua Duncan) for helping to see this project all the way to the end and providing a constant stream of invaluable feedback.<br>
<br>
We also wish to thank Bob Barnes for his fabulous work narrating the audio version of the BGT language tutorial.<br>
<br>
And last but not least, thanks to all of you who contribute ideas and suggestions as well as provide help to others on the Blastbay discussion forum. No software can survive without a user base and community, and we wish to express our great appreciation for all that you, the end users, are contributing.<br>
